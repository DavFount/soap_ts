<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project is the backend API for The SOAP Dish. It is currently under development and will be changing rapidly as various features get added in. At its core it was designed to provide a modern way for people to spend time in the word of God from where ever they are as long as they have an internet connection.

Spending time with God is the only way to truly become closer to Him. To read His words and to live by those words means you must understand what is being said. The SOAP method encourages that deeper dive into the word by slowing you down and allows you to digest and understand what is being said. SOAP can take as little as 15 minutes or as long as you need. We provide a toolkit to aid in your study of the Bible. You can share your studies with others and help spread the word to those who may not yet be saved.

#### What is SOAP?

- **Scripture** - Write down your verse.
- **Observation** - What jumps out at you during your reading? Who is writing these verses? Who is the audience? When was it written?
- **Application** - How can you apply this verse to your life? How would your life look if you truly lived by these words? Make it personal.
- **Prayer** - Pray over God's words. Ask for help understanding and guidence to apply the word to your life.

### Built With

This application was built using Express.js on the backend and Vue.JS on the front end. I utilized the Bootstrap CSS Framework for developing a user friendly interface for users.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This application is still in the development phase. You are welcome to download or browse the code if you'd like. However, the code is rapidly changing and your local copy will likly be outdated very quickly. Once he application is completed you will be able to access it on the web by going to [The SOAP Dish](https://thesoapdish.app).

### Prerequisites

Download the Code and navigate to the folder and execute one of the below commands.

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```
- yarn
  ```sh
  yarn
  ```

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

As features/ideas come to mind I will continually update this section with additional items.

- [x] Convert the JavaScript API to TypeScript
- [x] Setup a User authentication system with profile support
- [x] Implement following of other users (partially completed)
- [ ] Implement an Online Bible in various translations (Looking for partners)
- [ ] Add the ability share SOAP forms to the public to complete (Idea is to allow small groups to share a link to members to complete and save them in a specific location.)

See the [open issues](https://github.com/DavFount/soap_ts/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
